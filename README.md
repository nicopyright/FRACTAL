__<span style=" font-size:4em;"> Fractals </span>__

Fractals is a school project to <span style="color: purple;">_ _ init _ _</span> ourselves to python.  
This projects is a program that generates fractals and display them.

## How to generate fractals :
In this project we are only focusing on Julia set and Mandelbrot fractals.  
To generate a Julia fractal we analise the limit of the following sequence of a complex z:  
<div align="center">
    <em>f</em> (z) = zÂ² + c
</div>
where z correspond to every pixel of the screen and c the constant complex 
that define the fractal.

So if the sequence converge, we display a color and if the sequence diverge, we display a scale of grey.
The color and gray intensity are define by the velocity of the convergence or divergence.

## Some examples of fractals :

</div>
